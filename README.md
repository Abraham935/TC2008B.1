# TC2008B.1
 Multiagents model simulation solution.
 
 This project consists in a traffic simulation that shows how to through using python with agent-based modeliing,
 we find a way to reduce the volume of traffic and then we generate a JSON with this data in order to generate
 the simulation. I was part of the front-end of this project by creating the default and different position of the camera, 
 adding lighting effects, GUI, buildings and traffic lights.
 
 Technologies:
 
 -Python with agent.py.
 -HTML with WebGL
